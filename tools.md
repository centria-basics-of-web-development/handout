    Oct 14 22:44 index_html_FINAL.html
    Nov 15 16:10 index_html_draft_FINAL.html
```

2. When you work in pairs or a team, have you sent the following message to the others?

*"Could you send me the files you worked on, I can put them together."*

These are just some, not all, scenarios that a version control system can fit. One of the more popular version control systems is Git, although many others exist. Git can be downloaded for free from http://git-scm.com/. It is a line-based version control system. That means that if one character is changed on one line, that one line is considered altered. This makes it effective even when using large files.

You can learn a lot more about version control and Git by reading the ebook on the Git homepage. Sections 2.2 - 2.5 of the said book cover most of what is needed on this course.
